# Raid Farm Macro 

This is a standalone macro program to operate [IanXO4's raid farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVHFIfZAL54)
The benefit of using it instead of replaying a single macro is:
* can be ran in the background
* configurable attacking period
* more stable once per second attacks

## Usage

* Download the latest release Raid farm macro [HERE](https://github.com/KartulUdus/RaidFarmMacro/releases/) and Open it
* Open Minecraft and press Ctrl + j. The app will confirm it's connected to minecraft now
* Optionally change your killing period and press OK, but I found good results with the default 40 seconds
* In Minecraft press F3 + P and make sure "Pause on lost focus" is disabled
* Head to your Raid farm with the "Bad omen" effect 
* Make sure you have default controls (left mosue for attack, right to use and wasd for movement)
* Place food in your offhand 
* Look at your killing area at a right angle (-90째 , -0째 or 90째), looking up at -54째
* Make sure the spawning platform is flooded when starting
* Press Ctrl+Shift+j to start the macro
* Press Alt+Tab to change focus from Minecraft to some other app
* Enjoy browsing the web or doing other stuff while your raid farm is running
* Once done or if you want to pause to craft emerald blocks, use Ctrl+Shift+J to pause or Ctrl+Alt+J to quit
