# Raid Farm Macro 

This is a standalone macro program to operate [IanXO4's raid farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVHFIfZAL54)
The benefit of using it instead of replaying a single macro is:
* can be ran in the background
* configurable attacking period
* more stable once per second attacks

Use the program at your own risk. If you don't trust me, do not use the program. If you'd like to view the source code of this project, look at [the script](https://github.com/Beatso/SimpleAutoClicker/blob/master/main.ahk) in this GitHub repository. If you'd like to use an uncompiled version of the code rather than the .exe file, see [How can I run the uncompiled program in AHK?](#how-can-i-run-the-uncompiled-program-in-ahk) below. I take no liability for any damage caused by the program.
